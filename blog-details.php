                        <h2>Norway</h2>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Discover the untamed beauty of Norway, a land where rugged
                            mountains, and enchanting northern lights paint a surreal
                            backdrop.
                        </p> 
                        <p>A paradise for surfers, the unsheltered peninsula Stadtlandet and the island of Vågsøy also have Norway’s oldest monastery ruins and three lighthouses that offer accommodation. The village of Hoddevika has even established a reputation as one of the more exotic surfing destinations in the world (against some incredibly stiff competition!). The three lighthouses, all of which boast panoramic views of the sea, are called Hendanes, Kråkenes and Skogsnes.</p>
                        <p>One of the many fantastic walks that include both mountains and fjords in Hardanger, from Eidfjord down to Husedalen, a stunning valley with three distinctive waterfalls. On the way you will experience the nature in the innermost part of the Hardangerfjord and pass the wild Hjølodalen and the mountain huts in Viveli, Hedlo and Hadlaskard; the Hårteigen mountain, which is the highest point and a great landmark on the Hardangervidda plateau; and finally Husedalen and the Munketrappene steps.</p>
                        <p>The scenery and waterfalls in Husedalen simply take your breath away. Four stunning waterfalls are close to each other along the hiking trail from Kinsarvik up to the Hardangervidda mountain plateau. A hike from the car park to the uppermost fall and back takes 5-6 hours. The area is easily accessible and a good alternative for hikes of any length. Hardanger Fossasti (footpath) is a light walk starting in Kinsarvik. Follow the path along the river and read the information boards.</p>
                        <p>There is a wonderful atmosphere in Skudeneshavn, home of the tall ship fleet. Absorb the pervading calm of the narrow streets and alleyways as you relish fresh waffles and coffee in quaint cafes. Or revel in the vibrant festivities of festival days. Or simply explore wonderful walks, beaches and coastline. Idyllic Skudeneshavn is the new addition to Norway`s specially selected cultural environments that are protected by the Cultural Heritage Act. This provision provides the legal authority to protect a cultural environment because of the value of the area.</p>
